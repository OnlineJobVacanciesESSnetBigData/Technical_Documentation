Towards a methodological framework for the integration of online job advertisements data in the production of official statistics 

The aim of implementing this pilot is to produce statistical estimates in the statistical theme of online job vacancies. Suitable techniques and concrete methodologies were developed during the pilot phase of the project. Implementation will be based on work that was carried out regarding the conditions that web scraping techniques can be used as far as the quality of the scraped data is concerned, as well as the use of mixed sources including job portals and job adverts on enterprise websites, and job vacancy data from third party sources. Relationships with the project of Cedefop will be consequently explored. Within the same statistical theme, the combination of existing data from multiple sources will be promoted and embedded in the methodology. The final aim of the activities is to develop and test the methodology and prototypes as well as capacity building to facilitate their integration into production at the level of individual NSI and at the level of the ESS.
